            <p class="overview-para">Getting Rapunzel-like strands is no easy feat—ask anyone who’s gobbled down countless biotin pills and vitamin E supplements only to be greeted with the same lackluster strands. There are a lot of factors that contribute to hair growth (or lack thereof), but one of the most overlooked is physical stimulation—as in massaging the heck out of your scalp. Turns out giving yourself a scalp massage using some key natural ingredients can help retain length and, in turn, make your strands look more Blake Lively–esque.1 There’s also the whole egg-yolk-mask thing, and let’s not forget the sworn-by hot castor oil treatment.

              With plenty of natural treatment options, achieving the hair of your dreams doesn’t have to feel so far-fetched. Just remember, there isn’t an ingredient or method that can actually make your hair grow faster from the root. Instead, you’ll want to follow the tips below to grow healthier, stronger hair that will reduce breakage at the ends and, in turn, promote length.
              
              To help us figure out how to make hair grow faster, we hit up the pros. Keep scrolling for some simple and natural ways to achieve healthy, longer hair..</p>

            <h4>How fast does hair really grow?</h4>  
            <hr>
            <p>We are born with the total amount of hair follicles we will ever have over our lifetime. There may be about 5 million on our body, but our head has about 100,000 follicles. As we age, some follicles stop producing hair, which is how baldness or hair thinning occurs.

              The American Academy of Dermatology says that hair grows about 1/2 inch per month on average. That’s a grand total of about 6 inches per year for the hair on your head.
              
              How fast your hair grows will depend on your:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>age</li>
              
              <li>specific hair type</li>
              
              <li>overall health</li>
              
              <li>other health conditions</li>
              
            </ul>
            <p>Science has discovered a little bit about how hair growth is controlled at the cellular level in the body, but not enough to know how we can directly speed up hair growth. Read on to learn about the science behind hair growth and how to use that knowledge for healthier hair.</p>
            <br>

            <h4>The stages of hair growth</h4>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>Hair grows in three stages, and each strand of hair follows its own timeline. These three stages are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>anagen: active growth phase of hair that lasts 2-8 years</li>
              <li>catagen: transition phase where hair stops growing, lasts 4-6 weeks</li>
              <li>telogen: resting phase where hair falls out, lasts 2-3 months</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The average scalp has 90-95 percentTrusted Source of the hair follicles in anagen phase. This means about 5-10 percent are in the telogen phase, which accounts for the 100-150 hairs that fall out every day.

            </p>
            <h4>Can you increase the anagen phase for hair growth?</h4>
            <hr>
            <br>
            <p>How long the anagen phase lasts depends on how long your hair is and if the cells in your follicle base are continuing to multiply and become hair cells. Hair grows because matrix cells shed some of their structure as they reach the upper follicle. The shed structure combines with keratins to form hair strands that exit your skin’s surface.

              Researchers are still looking into what triggers our bodies to “turn on” the anagen phases. But there are steps you can take to promote healthy hair during the anagen phase.</p>
              <br>
            <h4>How to make your hair grow stronger</h4>
            <hr>
            <br>
              <p>Hair is made up of keratin and dead skin cells. While there’s no direct method to make your hair grow faster overnight, there are steps you can take to keep your hair healthy and long. Talk to your doctor before trying supplements such as biotin, keratin, or other nutritional supplements. They may interact with medications and cause unintended side effects.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>1. Keep up with vitamins and nutrients</h5>
              <br>
              <p>While many companies promote vitamins or supplements for hair growth, they don’t always directly affect hair length. But the body does require a lot of energy to make your hair grow. Missing out on balanced meals and nutrients can affect hair growth.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>2. Apply essential oils</h5>
              <br>
              <p>Put a few drops of into your shampoo or dilute it with jojoba oil. One study showed that pumpkin seedTrusted Source increases hair count for men with hair loss by 40 percent.

                Avoid applying essential oils directly to your skin. You can dilute the oil with a few drops of essential oil per ounce of carrier oil. Two other oils that may help include rosemaryTrusted Source and peppermintTrusted Source oil. While the trials have been animal studies, results suggest that these oils may benefit hair growth.
                
                You can also mix these essential oils with other carrier oils that preventTrusted Source hair damage, such as:
               </p>
                
                <br>
                <ul>
                  <li>coconut</li>
                  <li>sunflower</li>
                  <li>mineral</li>
                  <li>castor</li>
                </ul>
               </p>
              <br>
              <h5>3. Try topical ointments</h5>
              <br>
              <p>Topical ointments are generally for people experiencing hair loss. They may help your hair grow. Studies show that these products are effective in treating alopecia, or hair loss, and promoting hair growth:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>topical melatonin reducesTrusted Source hair loss and increases hair density</li>
                <li>topical minoxidil 5 percent slowsTrusted Source hair loss</li>
                <li>Propecia</li>
                <li>ketoconazole shampoo</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h5>4. Take keratin supplements</h5>
              <br>
              <p>There aren’t many studies on the effects of protein, keratin, and vitamins on hair health. One study looked at a product that had 500 milligrams of keratin and other vitamins and minerals. The group that took the supplement showed:</p>
              <br>
              <ul>
                <li>12.5 percent reduction in hair loss</li>
                <li>5.9 percent improved in hair strength</li>
                <li>improved hair brightness and luster</li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <h5>5. Use protein</h5>
              <br>
              <p>Protein helps your hair grow and protect it from chemical and environmental damage. If you style or apply heat to your hair often, using a protein treatment can protect your hair. You can purchase these online or use coconut oil at home. Coconut oil helps reduceTrusted Source protein lost both before and after washing hair.
                <br>
                Too much protein can affect your kidneys. It may also cause your hair to become brittle, although this is rare. It’s best to get protein from your diet and not supplements. You can get protein from vegetables, nuts, yogurt, and other foods.</p>
              <br>
              <h5>6. Caffeinate your follicles</h5>
              <br>
              <p>Studies are still new on the effects of caffeine on hair growth, but a cell studyTrusted Source found that caffeine may have growth-promoting effects on hair. Using hair products with caffeine, like this shampoo by AB Crew, as an ingredient may help.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>What factors can affect hair growth?</h4>
              <hr>
              <br>
              <p>There are a few factors that can affect hair growth, including:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>genetics or family history of hair loss</li>
                <li>hormonal changes</li>
                <li>lack of nutrition</li>
                <li>medications</li>
                <li>stress</li>
                <li>trauma that damages follicles</li>
                <li>other diseases or conditions</li>
                
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p>It’s also important to note that if you are experiencing unexplained and severe hair loss, you should schedule a checkup with your doctor, as certain illnesses and health conditions can cause hair loss.</p>
              <br>
              <h4>Hair growth during and after pregnancy</h4>
              <hr>
              <br>
              <p>Women who are pregnant may feel that their hair is actually growing faster. And women who have just had a baby may feel like they are losing their hair at a faster rate than normal. This is because during pregnancy, the hormone estrogen actually causes a woman to have a higher ratio of hair follicles in the growing phase. After the baby is born, hair follicles return to the “resting” phase, making it appear as if they are shedding hair.</p>
