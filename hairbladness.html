            <p class="overview-para">There are diverse types of alopecia and each call for a specific treatment. Regrettably there
                is no curative solution to the problem of alopecia as most drugs target its management.
                The purpose of the review is to explore the different types of alopecia and how each
                affect hair appearance and growth. The review begins by describing hair structure and
                hair physiological changes during life progression. A detailed description of conventional
                medication prescribed for alopecia and associated adverse effects are also pronounced
                in this review. Both approved (minoxidil and finasteride) and unapproved medications
                indicated for the condition are discussed to expose voids, which need to be filled by future
                drug development. The review also discusses the prospective future therapies of alopecia as

                <h4 class="Symptoms">Introduction of Alopecia</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Alopecia is a condition, which results in loss of hair from one’s
                head or other body parts where hair is naturally supposed to be found.
                The distressful condition causes low self-esteem affecting patients
                psychologically and socially.1
                 There are diverse categories of alopecia
                but the commonest are androgenic alopecia (common baldness),
                alopecia areata and chemotherapy induced alopecia.2
                 Causes of the
                conditions are many including stress, heredity, hormonal, nutrition,
                some sickness as well as certain medications like those prescribed
                for cancer.3-4 Although the FDA sanctioned only two serendipitous
                drugs (finasteride and minoxidil) for the management of alopecia,
                there are many unapproved medications which are claimed to reversethe condition.5
                Other products that are claimed to reverse hair loss
               lack persuading proof from controlled scientific experiments, thereby
               hindering wider use and commercialization.
               Hair grows in a cyclic manner comprising of four phases namely
               anagen, catagen, telogen and exogen.6
                These four phases keep on
               recurring as long as the person’s follicles are capable of producing
               hair. The most active phase of hair growth, commonly known as the
               anagen last for a period of 2 to 7 years and about 90 % of hair in a
               healthy scalp are in this phase.7
                The anagen phase becomes shorter
               progressively after each cycle causing the production of weaker and
               villus hair. The phases which follow after the anagen are characterized
               by hair recession and are shorter in a healthy scalpGenerally, all forms of alopecia shorten the hair growth cycle and
               lead to loss of hair in two ways. The first is the shortening of anagen
               phase as is characteristic of androgenic alopecia. This results in the
               drop of anagen: telogen hair ratio from the normal 6: 1 to as low as
               2:1 and thus lengthening the telogen phase.9
                The second way is the
               shrinking of the dermal papilla, which is responsible for hair follicle
               cell differentiation and growth through the supply of nutrients. The
               shrinkage of the dermal papilla is due to vasoconstriction of blood
               vessels supplying nutrients and oxygen to hair.9
                This leads to hair
               alteration in both diameter and appearance causing an abrupt change
               from thick and pigmented hair to vellus distorted hair (thin and white)</p>

               <h4>Types of alopecia and their causes</h4>
                  <hr>
                  <br>
                <p> There are many different types of alopecia as there are different
                    causes of the condition. Common types are androgenic alopecia,
                    alopecia areata, chemotherapy induced alopecia (CIA), anagen
                    effluvium, telogen effluvium traction alopecia and trichotillomania.
                    The condition can be classified into two categories; scarring alopecia
                    (instigated by swelling responses to follicle damage) and most
                    common non-scarring alopecia caused by many factors such as
                    hormones, medication, nutrition and certain illnesses</p>
                      <br>
                       <h5>Androgenic alopecia</h5>
                      <p>This is common baldness affecting both male (male pattern
                        baldness) and female (female pattern baldness). It affects mostly
                        men as compared to women because men produce more of the
                        causative male sex hormone testosterone. In women, the condition
                        has a different phenotypical expression depicted as scalp hair thinning
                        unlike the hairline recession in men.10 The metabolism of testosterone
                        in the gonads and other parts of the body such as the liver and brain by
                        an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase produces a strong androgen called
                        dihydrotestosterone (DHT). About 10 % of the testosterone produced
                        in the body gets converted to DHT.11 DHT, also a sex steroid like
                        testosterone, accelerates baldness more compared to other androgens
                        targeting the same receptor sites with a higher binding affinity(binds
                        easily lasting for 53 minutes were as testosterone lasts for only
                        35 minutes). The binding of androgensto hair follicle receptors causes
                        progressive shrinkage and weakening of follicles causing destruction
                        of follicle cells. The interface of hair follicle with androgens results
                        in reduced anagen lifespan and prolonged telogen lifespan. According
                        toUrysiak-Czubatka et al12, androgenic alopecia affects 70 % of all
                        men and about 40 % of ladies in their entire lifespan. Male individuals
                        who do not develop baldness generally produce less quantities of
                        the 5-alpha reductase enzyme. Androgenic alopecia affects people
                        of Caucasian origin more than other races</p>
                      <h5>Alopecia areata</h5>
                      <br>
                      <p>Alopecia areata is a non-scarring autoimmune condition, which
                        results in loss of hair in one’s scalp or any other body parts.15 The
                        causative of the condition is still obscure; with some speculations
                        reporting it to be an organ-explicit immune system infection
                        interceded by T lymphocytes coordinated at hair follicles.16 Other
                        reports say hereditary predisposition and natural variables may
                        instigate the sickness.17 The condition is characterized by the presence
                        of scattered bald patches around the affected area, usually the scalp.
                        The scalp patches can develop into bigger ones if the condition is not
                        suppressed. The condition affected both male and female equally but
                        most popular in infants.18
                        A deteriorating scenario for alopecia areata is when patients end
                        up with an absolutely hairless scalp (alopecia totalis). Alopecia areata
                        can also result in loss of hair on the whole body, a condition known as
                        alopecia universalis. Alopecia areata may not ordinarily lead to death
                        of hair follicle cells as hair often grows after recovery when proper
                        body signals are assumed. Plenty products have been purported to
                        reverse alopecia areata but none stood the test of time because of
                        ineffectiveness and side effects. Interventions with products such as
                        zinc, cortocosteroids, dithranol, tretinoin, azelaic acid, systematic
                        cortisone, minoxidil and immuno-suppressive remedies have been
                        widely used with limited success to combat alopecia areata. There
                        is still need to find reliable cure for alopecia areata. Other causes of
                        alopecia areata as adopted from Amin and Sachdeva.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h5>Chemotherapy induced alopecia</h5>
                        <br>
                        <p>Loss of scalp hair is one of the dreaded adverse effects of
                            chemotherapy causing some patients to deny or omit treatment.19
                            Chemotherapy treatments attack fast growing cell types and not
                            only neoplastic cancer cells. This leads to the attack of fast-growing
                            hair fiber keratinocytes in the active growth phase leading to loss of
                            hair.20 Hair matrix keratinocytes at the anagen stage are the absolute
                            quickest multiplying cells in the body, about 60% of them stay in
                            the synthesis (S) stage. Chemotherapeutic medications target rapid
                            growing neoplastic malignancy cells and, in the process, destroying
                            fast growing hair matrix keratinocytes in anagen growth phase.21
                            Consequently, the follicles in the anagen stage are exposed to a faster
                            dystrophic catagen phase followed by the breaking of hair and its
                            subsequent shading.
                            After chemotherapy, 90 % of hairs in the anagen stage (majority
                            of scalp hair) are transformed to telogen and consequently shade off
                            as club hair but without replacement. This triggers longer telogen
                            phases and shortens anagen phases in the hair cycle. In most cases,
                            hair lost after chemotherapy regrows when the patient stops taking
                            the medication because cycling follicular stem cells are usually not
                            affected by the treatment and will generate a new hair follicle, which
                            will produce a new hair strand later. Decent upkeep of hair follicles
                            during chemotherapy requires therapeutic tactics such as telogen
                            arresting and catagen inhibition. This could be solved by treatment
                            with follicle keratinocytes apoptosis obstructive agents.20 Regrettably
                            at present there are no apoptosis obstructive agents or telogen arresting
                            remedies to give to patients. It is desirous to come up with treatments
                            for fortifying hair healthy during chemotherapy</p>
                            <br>
                            <h5>Anagen effluvium</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p>The condition results in the shading off of growing hair in the
                                anagen stage (anagen arrest).22 Just like chemotherapy induced
                                alopecia the anagen effluvium can be triggered by chemotherapy or
                                other medications.23 The condition leads to loss of anagen hair causing
                                very long telogen phase, which lasts for as long the treatment is being
                                administered to the patient. Excessive use of medications like blood
                                thinners, birth control pills, diuretics, and acne drugs is also believed
                                to prompt the disorder. Even though in most cases the condition can
                                be reversed and hair grows back after a period of up to 3 months,
                                the condition can be irreversible leading to psychological torture
                                impacting negatively to the patient’s sensitivity of appearance.</p>

                                <h5>Telogen effluvium</h5>
                                <br>
                                <p>Telogen effluvium denotes to non-scarring hair loss due to
                                    untimely pushing of hair follicles into the inactive telogen stage.24 The
                                    disorder is common to the old aged, physical and emotional stressed
                                    people, as well as thyroid or other hormonal irregularities.25-26 The
                                    level of effluvium relies upon the gravity and duration of exposure to
                                    the causative agent as opposed to the agent itself. Telogen effluvium
                                    can be critical (going on for below six months), chronic (more than six
                                    months) or chronic repetitive</p>

                            <h5>Traction alopecia</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p>Traction alopecia is typically instigated by tensional straining
                                activities on hair leading to its breakage.27 Middle aged ladies are
                                mostly affected because of the high desire to look presentable by
                                trying varying hair styles. Hair styles such as braiding, tight pig tails,
                                repeated chemical treatments like hair bleaching and dying are the
                                basic reasons for traction alopecia.28 Traction alopecia happens in
                                people of various cultural origins and is the after effect of a person’s
                                hair styling and hair care practices.</p>

                                <p>This type of alopecia emanates from frequent self-plucking of hair
                                    from one’s scalp resulting in hair loss or damage. In most cases it is
                                    associated with children or psychiatric patients who routinely pluck
                                    off their hair.29 Interventions in such conditions involve psychiatric
                                    treatment for adults and in young children; the habit may disappear
                                    as the child grows.</p>

                            <h4>Medication for alopecia</h4>
                            
                            <hr>     
                            <p>There are several remedies to manage alopecia albeit plenty
                                reports of adverse reactions and ineffectiveness. Both natural and
                                synthetic remedies are reported although there are only two drugs,
                                (topical minoxidil and oral finasteride) which were sanctioned for hair
                                regrowth by FDA. Due to diversified alopecia types, alopecia drugs
                                are not universally prescribed but rather target a specific type</p> 
                            <br>
                            <h5>Minoxidil (Rogaine)</h5>
                            <br>
                            <p>Commercial name rogaine is the only FDA sanctioned
                                topical application drug against alopecia. Minoxidil is a pyrimidine
                                derivative originally used as an orally administered treatment for
                                hypertension.31 The hair growth promotion popularly known for minoxidil was discovered serendipitously as its side effect for the
                                treatment of hypertension.32 Prescriptions for minoxidil are normally
                                packaged in strengths of 5% (for male use) and 2% for female use.
                                The drug’s mechanism of stimulating hair regrowth remains elusive
                                up to now, although it is a well-known potassium channel opener
                                that is responsible for hyperpolarization of cell membranes. The
                                hyperpolarization causes vasodilation, angiogenesis, and opening of
                                potassium channels thereby facilitating the entrance of more oxygen,
                                blood, and food nutrients to the follicles.33-34 Thus, the provision of
                                nutrients and good blood supply is suspected to have some significant
                                contribution to hair rejuvenation by minoxidil. Minoxidil facilitates
                                the transformation of follicles in telogen phase back to anagen. A
                                prolonged active growth phase has also been reported after treatment
                                with topical minoxidil.</p>
                                <br>
                                <h5>Finasteride (Propecia)</h5>
                                <br>
                            <p>Finasteride (synthetic 4-azasteroid compound) is one of the
                                FDA sanctioned drugs for the treatment of alopecia. Like minoxidil,
                                finasteride was also serendipitously discovered as a hair growth
                                promoter. Prior to its use in trichology, finasteride was used to treat
                                prostate enlargement in men.35 Apparently, the drug is prescribed
                                to male patients experiencing hair loss only. Finasteride works by
                                inhibiting 5 alpha reductase, an enzyme that catalyzes the metabolism
                                of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). The use of finasteride
                                competitively inhibits the 5 alpha reductase enzymes on the androgen
                                receptors thereby preventing the conversion of testosterone into DHT.
                                Effective results in the handling of androgenic alopecia with finasteride
                                are observed when the drug is administered early or before the death
                                of hair follicles. Unlike minoxidil, which can be used by both male
                                and female patients, finasteride is contraindicated to female patients,
                                particularly pregnant ones due to its teratogenic effect.36 Treatment for
                                androgenic alopecia with finasteride often yield reversible hair loss
                                because the drug does not address the genetic cause of the condition
                                and thus hair loss will likely recur. The two approved drugs, minoxidil
                                and finasteride were reported to have side effects in some cases</p>

                                <p>Despite there being only minoxidil and finasteride sanctioned by
                                    FDA for the treatment of alopecia, there are a plethora of medications
