            <hr>
            <p class="overview-para">Hair loss is a common problem in men and women. Correct diagnosis of hair disorders is complex and requires evaluation of clinical presentation, history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Hair loss may be categorized as hair shaft abnormalities, permanent alopecia, or nonpermanent alopecia. Nonpermanent alopecia, the most common type, includes androgenetic alopecia, telogen effluvium, alopecia areata, and traction alopecia. The hallmark of this group is the possibility of complete regrowth with adequate treatment.</p>

                Hair loss can appear in many different ways, depending on what's causing it. It can come on suddenly or gradually and affect just your scalp or your whole body.
                <br>
                Signs and symptoms of hair loss may include:  
                Gradual thinning on top of head. This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age. In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead. Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair. An increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women is a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia).
                Circular or patchy bald spots. Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp, beard or eyebrows. Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls . <br>
                Sudden loosening of hair. A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary.
                Full-body hair loss. Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back. <br>
                Patches of scaling that spread over the scalp. This is a sign of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing. <br>
                When to see a doctor
                See your doctor if you are distressed by persistent hair loss in you or your child and want to pursue treatment. For women who are experiencing a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia), talk with your doctor about early treatment to avoid significant permanent baldness. <br>
                
                Also talk to your doctor if you notice sudden or patchy hair loss or more than usual hair loss when combing or washing your or your child's hair. Sudden hair loss can signal an underlying medical condition that requires treatment.</p>
              
                <h4 class="prevention">prevention</h4>
            <hr>
            <p class="prevention-para">You can lose hair for a variety of reasons, ranging from your genes to your diet to health issues and more. That’s why it’s important to see a dermatologist. They can pinpoint the cause and let you know if you need medical treatments.
              <br>
              They may also recommend certain lifestyle changes to help you prevent more hair loss. These expert tips help some men get thicker, healthier hair.  
              <br>
              <br>
              1. Take Charge of Stress
              <br>
              <br>
              
              “I recommend for patients experiencing any type of hair loss to minimize stress by exercising, getting adequate sleep, and practicing self-care with activities such as meditation or yoga,” board-certified dermatologist Brooke Jeffy, MD, tells WebMD Connect to Care.
              <br>
              Managing stress helps some people with a type of hair loss called alopecia areata, in which the immune system mistakenly attacks hair follicles, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. A 2018 study published in the journal Skin Appendage Disorders found that stress can increase inflammation in follicles, leading to hair shedding. Reducing stress allows hair to fight off the inflammation and resume its natural growth cycle. 
              <br>
              <br>
              2. Make Scalp Massage a Habit
              <br>
              <br>
              “I recommend a 5-minute scalp massage daily as a simple method to not only increase blood flow to the hair follicles, but also to give patients a few minutes to themselves to de-stress,” Jeffy says.
              <br>
              <br>
              3. Revamp Your Diet
              <br>
              <br>
              Great hair begins with top-notch nutrition. “Essentially, maintaining healthy skin and healthy hair is related to having a healthy, balanced diet and good hydration with water intake,” says double board-certified plastic surgeon Ricardo Castrellón, MD, who does hair transplants among other procedures. Castrellón recommends a diet rich in: 
              <br>
              Healthy proteins <br>
              Fruits and vegetables <br>
              Nuts <br>
              Avoid sugar and processed foods, Castrellón says.<br>
              <br>
              4. Supplement When Needed
              <br>
              <br>
              If you’re low on certain nutrients, that can cause hair loss, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. These nutrients include:
              <br>
              Biotin<br>
              Protein<br>
              Iron <br>
              Zinc<br>
              Omega-3 fatty acids<br>
              According to the American Academy of Dermatology, your doctor can give you a blood test to find out if you’re getting enough hair-healthy nutrition from food. If you’re not, they may recommend supplements. Always check with your doctor before you try a new supplement. If you are not deficient in nutrients, taking more won’t likely help and may cause a problem.</p>
              <br>
              <h4 class="Supplements">Supplements</h4>
            <hr>
            <p class="Supplements-para">Many vitamins and minerals are needed for proper hair development and growth. Some nutritional deficiencies can potentially lead to hair loss.
              <br> 
              Supplementing with vitamin D may help reduce symptoms Trusted Sourceof genetic hair loss or telogen effluvium. However, more research is neededTrusted Source to definitively understand the link. Supplementing with iron may help reduce symptoms in people who are iron deficient. People with low iron may also benefit from supplementing with vitamin C if they aren’t getting enough.
              <br>
              Research Trusted Sourcehas also found a link between low vitamin D and alopecia areata, a patchy form of hair loss caused by an autoimmune reaction. It’s recommended that people with this condition supplement with vitamin D if they’re deficient.
              <br>
              There currently isn’t adequate evidence that supplementation of the following can help with hair loss:
              <br>
              zinc
              riboflavin (vitamin B2)<br>
              folic acid (vitamin B9)<br>
              vitamin B12<br>
              biotin<br>
              vitamin E<br>
              Some small studiesTrusted Source have found too much vitamin A or selenium can cause hair loss, but more research is needed. Researchers are continuing to examine if there’s any benefit for people with alopecia areata to supplement with iron or zinc.
              <br>
              Remember to only buy supplements from trusted sources, as they aren’t vetted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p>
              <br>
              <h4 class="Medications">Medications</h4>
              <hr>
              <br>
              <p>There are over-the-counter medications available that may help treat hair loss. These include foams and ointments.
                <br>
                The two most common medications are minoxidil (Rogaine) and finasteride (Propecia).</p>
                <br>
              <h5 class="Minoxidil">Minoxidil</h5>
              <p>Scientists originally developed minoxidilTrusted Source to treat high blood pressure. Its developers found that it had the side effect of excessive, unwanted hair growth. This effect gave drug companies reason to consider it for male baldness.
                <br>
                Researchers do not know exactly how minoxidil works. The drug appears to widen the hair follicle, which causes a thicker strand of hair to grow.
                <br>
                In addition, minoxidil appears to prolong the growth period of hair, which results in longer hair and a higher number of hair strands. When used properly, minoxidil has been shown to be safe and effective.
                <br>
                It is more effective in individuals who are under 40 years of age.
                <br>
                A 2019 reviewTrusted Source notes that topical minoxidil is only approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of androgenetic alopecia in males and females. However, minoxidil is used off-label for other hair disorders, such as alopecia areata, scarring alopecia, and hair shaft disorders.
                <br>
                The FDATrusted Source notes that the term “off-label” refers to approved medications that doctors prescribe for unapproved uses.
                <br>
                Minoxidil can cause some side effects, includingTrusted Source: </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                <li>hair shedding</li>  <br>
                <li>skin irritation and redness</li> <br>
                <li>itchy, yellow, or white scales on the scalp</li> <br>
                <li>allergic contact dermatitis</li> <br>
                <li>excessive hair growth over the body, including on the face in some females</li> 
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Minoxidil is also not suitable for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or for those who have a hypersensitivity to the ingredients in this medication.</p>
                  
                <br>
                <h5 class="Finasteride">Finasteride</h5>
                <p>FinasterideTrusted Source is a treatment for male pattern baldness, which appears at the crown and middle of the scalp.
                  <br>
                  This drug carries several warnings about its use. It is only suitable for adults and is not suitable for people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, or for children.
                  <br>
                  Scientists originally created finasteride to fight prostate cancer. It works by decreasing the amount of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the scalp. DHT appears to cause hair follicles in the scalp to become thinner, so reducing DHT levels may promote hair regrowth and slow hair loss.
                  <br>
                  Unlike minoxidil, finasteride does not affect hair growth on other parts of the body.
                  <br>
                  Finasteride is available in both topical and oral forms. A 2020 review states that the topical formulation of this drug is less likely to cause severe side effects than the oral version.
                  <br>
                  Some side effects of finasteride include:</p>
                  <ul>
                 <li> erectile dyfunction</li><br>
                 <li>decreased libido</li><br>
                 <li>decreased ejaculate volume</li><br>
                 <li>depression</li><br>
                  </ul>
                 <p>Individuals who take finasteride to treat male pattern hair loss may have to wait 3 months until they see noticeable results.</p>
                 <br>
                 <h5> Therapies</h5>
                 <br>
                 <p> Therapies for hair loss often involve a combination of drugs, ointments, creams, and shampoos, which a dermatologist may prescribe.
                  <br>
                  Learn more about hair growth products available online.
                  <br>
                  Other therapies involve meeting with specialists. Several companies specialize in hair treatments for men. They typically offer services to help work out the best course of action and tailor treatments to the individual’s needs.</p>
                  <br>
                 <h5>Surgery</h5> 
                 <br>
                 <p> The only surgery available for hair loss is hair transplant surgery.
                  <br>
                  Hair transplantation works for men with male pattern baldness. A hair transplant involves removing hair follicles from the back of the head, where they are resistant to DHT, and placing them on the scalp.
                  <br>
                  As with any surgery, hair transplants carry the risk of complications. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons states that the risks of hair transplant surgery include excessive bleeding and wide scars. Additionally, there is a chance the skin plugs may die, which requires further surgery to fix.</p>
                  <br>
                 <h5> Laser combs</h5>
                 <br>
                 <p> Laser combs are a newer form of hair loss treatment. Advocates claim these devices promote hair growth by using concentrated light to stimulate hair follicles.
                  <br>
                  This treatment has mixed results and may work best when combined with other forms of treatment.
                  <br>
                  A 2014 studyTrusted Source reviewed the effects of low-level laser therapy in 32 men and women with androgenetic alopecia. The researchers found that laser combs used in combination with minoxidil and finasteride may help stimulate hair growth.
                
               </p>
                <br>
                 <h5> Wigs and hair pieces</h5>
                 <br>
                <p>  In some cases, hair loss may be permanent or long term. Other men might prefer a nonmedical approach to treating hair loss. Wigs and hairpieces offer a means of disguising hair loss.
                  <br>
                  Wigs and hairpieces have advanced enormously in recent years. If the baldness is caused by a medical condition, the cost of a wig may also be covered by a person’s insurance provider. It is important to check insurance coverage before purchasing a wig.</p>
